# args_and_kwargs
Repo used to store the scripts I wrote to practice the application of args and kwargs.

See args and kwargs being used in code at work. Was not sure how they worked and wanted to get some practice with different applications. I recreated several examples I found online and read up on the unpacking operators and in what scenarioâ€™s they could be used.
Kwarg example 1
This is an example database connection using kwargs
Kwarg example 2
Is a greeting function using kwargs allowing the user to push a greeting into the terminal.
Kwarg example 3
Is a function using kwargs to store student information in a dictionary. 
Kwarg example 4
Is a function using kwargs to store Employee information in a dictionary. 
Kwarg example 5
Example of function calling a kwarg and looping through it using an arg creating a dictionary.
Arg example 1
Example showing an arg allowing the user to enter an previously unknown amount of integers

Interesting functionality that I will incorporate moving forward.
